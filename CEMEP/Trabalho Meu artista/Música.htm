&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First winter's snowfall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing backyard snowballs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warming up by the fireplace<br />
Marshmallows catch fire <br />
on an open flame<br /><br />

All my friends get together<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wishing I was There but I'll never<br />
Living in sunshine oh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But dreaming of a place called home<br /><br />

I wanna run, wanna run away<br />
Hey<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm dreaming of a place called home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could try but I'm stuck here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I'm dreaming of a place that's<br /><br />

3000 miles away<br />
Feels like it's forever<br />
Seems like yesterday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were running 'round town together<br />
This place just ain't the same<br />
I miss the stormy weather<br />
I'm not okay<br />
3000 miles away<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't pick up but I keep redialing<br />
Cause you're asleep<br />
Got your phone on silent<br />
Still early here I'm wide awake<br />
I just want to hear you tell me all about your day<br /><br />

Although I never really showed it<br />
I had to leave for me to notice<br />
That living in the sunshine's cold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm dreaming of a place called home<br /><br />

I wanna run, wanna run away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey I'm dreaming of a place called home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could try but I'm stuck here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I'm dreaming of a place that's<br /><br />

3000 miles away<br />
Feels like it's forever<br />
Seems like yesterday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were running round town together<br />
This place just ain't the same<br />
I miss the stormy weather<br />
I'm not okay<br />
3000 miles...<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I could go back for the weekend<br />
Or just for a day<br />
To see familiar faces<br />
That's all it would take<br />
But it's too far<br /><br />

3000 miles away<br />
Feels like it's forever<br />
Seems like yesterday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were running round town together<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This place just ain't the same<br />
I miss the stormy weather<br />
I'm not okay<br />
3000 miles<br /><br /> </b>
