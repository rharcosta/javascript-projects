Taking it slow but it's not typical<br />
He already knows that my love is fire<br />
His heart was a stone, but then his hands roamed<br />
I turned him to gold and I took him higher <br />
Well I'll be your daydream<br />
I'll be your favorite things<br />
We could be beautiful<br />
Get drunk on the good life<br />
I'll take you to paradise<br />
Say you'll never let me go<br /><br />

Deep in my bones I can feel you<br />
Take me back to a time only we knew<br />
Hideaway<br />
We could waste the night with an old film<br />
Smoke a little weed on the couch in the backroom<br />
Hideaway<br /><br />

Say you'll never let me go<br />
Say you'll never let me go<br /><br />

Ah ah ah<br />
Ah ah ah<br />
Ah ah ah<br />
Say you'll never let me go<br />
Say you'll never let me go<br />
Say you'll never let me go<br /><br />

Ah<br />
Ah<br />
Say you'll never let me go<br /><br />

Deep in my bones I can feel you<br />
Take me back to a time only we knew<br />
Hideaway<br />
We could waste the night with an old film<br />
Smoke a little weed on the couch in the backroom<br />
Hideaway<br />
Say you'll never let me go<br />
Say you'll never let me go<br /><br />

Ah ah ah<br />
Ah ah ah<br />
Ah ah ah<br />
Say you'll never let me go<br />
Say you'll never let me go<br /> </font>
